Fix 2: Install new batteries when using a Wireless or Bluetooth keyboard

During normal use of the keyboard, the batteries discharge. This may cause the computer and keyboard to lose connection. Replacing the batteries with new ones will reestablish a strong connection.

See Dell Knowledge Base Article Manuals and Documentation for your Dell Product for details on how to replace the batteries in your Wireless or Bluetooth keyboard.
Fix 3: Save any data, close any open programs, and restart the computer

Restarting the computer clears out the computer memory and resets the connection between the computer and the keyboard.

    Save updates to any open documents.
    Close any open programs or applications.
    Select the Start icon.
    Select the Power icon.
    Select Restart.

Check to ensure the keyboard is working correctly after the computer completely finishes booting.
